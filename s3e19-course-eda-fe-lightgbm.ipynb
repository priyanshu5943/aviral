The dataset includes various **`Features`** related to sales data, including date, country, product, and store identifiers. Each entry represents a unique sale, and the features include date-related attributes (like year, month, day, and day of the week), country, product, and store identifiers.\n\n## 🔧 Tools and Libraries\n\nWe will be using Python for this project, along with several libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Here are the main libraries we'll be using:\n\n- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.\n- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.\n- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.\n- **LightGBM**: For implementing the Light Gradient Boosting Machine model.\n\n## 📚 Dataset\n\nThe dataset we'll be using includes various features related to retail sales. Each row represents a unique sale and includes attributes such as date, country, product, and store identifiers. The dataset also includes a target variable 'num_sold' representing the number of products sold.\n\n## 🎯 Objective\n\nOur main objective is to develop a predictive model that can effectively forecast future sales based on the provided features. By leveraging the power of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine, we aim to enhance the model's accuracy and predictive performance.\n\n## 📈 Workflow\n\nHere's a brief overview of our workflow for this project:\n\n1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the data and preprocess it for analysis and modeling. This includes converting date columns to datetime format and extracting additional date-related features.\n\n2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distributions of features, and explore potential relationships between the features and sales.\n\n3. **Feature Engineering**: Perform feature engineering to extract additional relevant features or transform existing features to improve the model's performance.\n\n4. **Model Training and Validation**: Train the LightGBM model using a GroupKFold cross-validation strategy and make predictions on the test set.\n\n5. **Sales Disaggregation**: Disaggregate the forecasted total sales into product-level sales using historical sales ratios.\n\n6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics and assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data using the test set.\n\n7. **Prediction and Deployment**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. If applicable, deploy the model for practical use or further analysis.\n\n\n<br>\n\n![](https://images.pexels.com/photos/7718713/pexels-photo-7718713.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1)\n\n<br>\n\n## Domain Knowledge 📚\n\nLet's dive into the domain knowledge of the features used in this project:\n\n### Features\n\n- **`date`**: This is the date when the sales were recorded. Dates are fundamental in sales forecasting as sales tend to have temporal patterns such as trends (sales increasing or decreasing over time) and seasonality (patterns repeating at regular intervals, like daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly). For instance, retail sales often increase during holiday seasons or on specific days of the week.\n\n- **`country`**: This is the country where the sales were recorded. Country can be an important feature in sales forecasting as sales patterns often vary between countries due to factors like cultural differences, economic conditions, or different holidays.\n\n- **`product`**: This is the identifier of the product that was sold. Different products might have different sales patterns. For example, some products might sell more during certain seasons (like swimsuits in the summer or coats in the winter), while others might have steady sales throughout the year.\n\n- **`store`**: This is the identifier of the store where the sales were recorded. Different stores might have different sales patterns due to factors like location, size, customer demographics, or management practices.\n\n- **`Year, Month, Day, WeekDay`**: These are features derived from the date feature. They represent the year, month, day of the month, and day of the week of the sales, respectively. These features can help capture temporal trends and seasonality in the sales data. For example, sales might be higher on weekends (day of the week), during holiday seasons (month), or during specific years due to economic trends.\n\n- **`holiday_name`, `is_holiday_`**: These features represent the name of the holiday (if any) on the date of the sales, and whether the date was a holiday. Holidays often influence sales patterns, with sales typically increasing during holiday seasons.\n\n- **`ratios`**: This feature represents the historical ratios of product sales, used for disaggregating total sales into product-level sales. The assumption here is that the proportion of sales for each product will remain relatively stable over time. If this assumption holds, these ratios can be a useful tool for generating more detailed forecasts.\n\nUnderstanding these features and their relevance in the retail sales domain can help improve model performance and interpretability. This domain knowledge can guide the feature engineering process and help in the interpretation of the model's predictions.\n\n\n# <span style=\"color:#E888BB; font-size: 1%;\">INTRODUCTION</span>\n<div style=\"padding: 35px;color:white;margin:10;font-size:170%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:10px;overflow:hidden;background-image: url(https://images.pexels.com/photos/380337/pexels-photo-380337.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1)\"><b><span style='color:black'>Introduction</span></b> </div>\n\n<br>\n    \n## 📝 Abstract\n\nThis project presents an in-depth exploration and modeling of a retail sales dataset, with the primary objective of predicting sales at the product level 🎯. The dataset is characterized by a variety of **`Features`** 📊 including 'date' 📆, 'store' 🏪, 'country' 🌍, 'product' 📦, 'Year' 📅, 'Month' 📆, 'Day' 🗓️, 'WeekDay' 📅, and other engineered features capturing temporal patterns ⏳, cyclical trends 🔄, and special events (holidays) 🎉.\n\nOur exploratory data analysis revealed significant temporal patterns in sales, hinting at the influence of time ⏰ and special events 🎉 on the number of items sold. Additionally, we identified some anomalies in the data related to the period from March 2020 to May 2020, suggesting the need for robust anomaly detection 🕵️‍♀️ and handling methods in retail sales forecasting.\n\nWe harnessed the potential of ensemble models, specifically the <b><mark style=\"background-color:#526D82;color:white;border-radius:5px;opacity:1.0\">LightGBM Regressor</mark></b> 🚀, to predict total sales. The model was meticulously trained and validated using a GroupKFold cross-validation strategy 🔄, yielding variable scores across different folds.\n\nThe sales forecasts produced by the model were then disaggregated into product-level forecasts using historical sales ratios 📈. This approach assumes the stability of product sales ratios over time ⏳.\n\nThe project highlights the potential of machine learning 🧠 in retail sales forecasting, providing insights that could assist in inventory management 🗃️, sales planning 📝, and business strategy formulation 💼. Future efforts could focus on refining the predictive model 🔍, exploring different strategies for sales disaggregation 🧩, and integrating additional external data sources 🔄 to enhance the accuracy and detail of sales forecasts 📈.\n\n\n<br>\n\n### <b>I <span style='color:#FF8551'>|</span> Import neccessary libraries</b>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-12T11:39:39.400451Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-12T11:39:39.400873Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.523743Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-12T11:39:39.400837Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.522351Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <b>II <span style='color:#FF8551'>|</span> Input the Data</b> ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/playground-series-s3e19/train.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.525841Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.526184Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.794296Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.526154Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.793236Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <b>III <span style='color:#FF8551'>|</span> Get to know the Data</b> ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Summary statistics for numerical variables\nnumerical_summary = data.describe()\nnumerical_summary","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.795894Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.796434Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.835096Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.796396Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-12T11:39:41.834049Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Numerical Variables: 🔢\n\n1. **id:** 🆔 This is just an identifier column.\n\n2. **num_sold:** 📊 The count of items sold.

This suggests that there could be certain periods or specific conditions that lead to high sales.\n\n2. **Sales by Country 🌎**: Argentina has the highest number of sales among the countries, followed by Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. This could suggest a higher demand or more effective marketing strategies in these countries.\n\n3. **Sales by Store 🏪**: The Kaggle Learn store has the highest number of sales, followed by DataCamp and Coursera. This could indicate a preference for the types of products offered by these stores or their mode of delivery.\n\n4. **Sales by Product 🛍️**: All five products have a similar number of sales, with \"Using LLMs to Improve Your Coding\" being slightly more popular. This suggests a balanced portfolio of products.\n\n5. **Sales Trends Over Time ⏰**: There is an overall increasing trend in the number of products sold over time. Sales tend to increase around the middle of the year and then decrease towards the end of the year, indicating a possible seasonal effect.\n\n6. **Year 2020 Analysis 🗓️**: Compared to other years, The year 2020, marked by the global outbreak of COVID-19, shows a distinctive pattern compared to other years. During the period of March to June 2020, there were notable fluctuations in sales, likely due to the impacts of the pandemic and the ensuing global lockdown measures. This affected consumer behavior, leading to changes in the demand for products. Despite these fluctuations, sales in 2020 were generally higher, especially in the second half of the year, suggesting an adaptation to the new circumstances.\n\n<div style=\"border-radius: 10px; border: #EA906C solid; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffffff00; font-size: 100%; text-align: left;\">\n    📌 <b>Insight:</b> This adjustment highlights the potential effects of external events on sales trends.

The 'date' column was converted to datetime format and additional features such as 'Year', 'Month', 'Day', and 'WeekDay' were extracted.\n\n2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Sales trends were visualized by plotting the total number of sales over time. Anomalies were identified in the data between March 2020 and May 2020, which led to the decision to exclude this period from the analysis.\n\n3. **Feature Engineering:** A variety of features were engineered, including information about holidays, sine and cosine transformations of time variables to capture cyclical trends, and other date-related features. The holiday names were encoded using an ordinal encoder to convert them into a format that could be used in a machine learning model.\n\n4. **Model Training and Validation:** A LightGBM model was trained using 5-fold GroupKFold cross-validation, and predictions were made on the test set.

The insights, methodologies, and code snippets from the notebook have significantly contributed to the success of this project. The knowledge shared in the notebook has not only served as a solid foundation for this project but has also greatly enriched my understanding of machine learning techniques for sales forecasting.\n\n# <span style=\"color:#E888BB; font-size: 1%;\">SUGGESTION</span>\n<div style=\"padding: 35px;color:white;margin:10;font-size:170%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:10px;overflow:hidden;background-image: url(https://images.pexels.com/photos/380337/pexels-photo-380337.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1)\"><b><span style='color:black'>SUGGESTION</span></b> </div>\n\n###  There are some suggestions to potentially improve the model performance and sales forecasting:➕\n\n1. **Try Different Models:** 🔄 While `LightGBM` is a powerful model, there might be other models that could perform better on this dataset. Trying different models like `XGBoost`, `CatBoost`, or even deep learning models like `LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)` which are well-suited for time-series data could be beneficial. 🧠💡\n\n2. **Parameter Tuning:** 🎚️ The parameters used in the model might not be the optimal ones. Using techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning can help find a better set of parameters that might improve model performance. 🛠️🔄\n\n3. **Feature Engineering:** ⚙️ Additional features could be created that might help improve the model's performance. For instance, lagged features (values at prior time steps), rolling window statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc. over a certain past window), and trend features (upward, downward, stationary over a certain past window) can often be useful in time-series forecasting. 📊⏲️\n\n4. **Anomaly Detection:** ⚠️ The code currently excludes data from March 2020 to May 2020. Instead of simply excluding this data, you might consider implementing a formal anomaly detection method to identify and handle such periods. This could make your model more robust and adaptable to new data. 💪🔍\n\n5. **Cross-Validation Strategy:** 🎯 Instead of using `GroupKFold`, consider using a time-series specific cross-validation strategy, such as `TimeSeriesSplit`. This respects the temporal order of observations, which is important in time-series problems. ⏳🔄\n\n6. **Ensemble Methods:** 👥 Consider using ensemble methods. Combining predictions from multiple models can often lead to better performance than any single model. 🤝🧮\n\n7. **External Data:** 🌐 If possible, consider integrating external data sources that could have predictive power. For example, macroeconomic indicators, industry trends, or even weather data could potentially influence sales and could be worth including in your model. 🌦️📈\n\n8. **Model Interpretability:** 🔍 Consider using methods to interpret your model's predictions. Feature importance plots, partial dependence plots, or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values can provide insight into which features are driving your model's predictions. 💡📊\n\n\n<div class=\"warning\" style=\"background-color: #F8F3D4; border-left: 6px solid #FF5252;font-size: 100%; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #FF8551; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;\">🚧  Keep in Mind </h3>\nRemember, while these suggestions might improve the model, the extent of the improvement depends heavily on the data and the specific problem at hand. Therefore, it's always a good idea to experiment and validate these strategies before deciding on the best approach. 👨‍🔬🔬\n</div>\n\n\n<br>\n\n***\n\n<br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n   <span style=\"font-size: 4.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;\">THANK YOU!</span>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <span style=\"font-size: 5em;\">✔️</span>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n   <span style=\"font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial; max-width:1200px; display: inline-block;\">\n       If you discovered this notebook to be useful or enjoyable, I'd greatly appreciate any upvotes!
